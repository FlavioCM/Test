What I would differently if I were to build a full-scale web application is
first think about the software architecture of application. I would have to at least configure
a web server so users can access the web application. I would have a front end server
to serve up the user interface and a backend surver to take of the business logic. With
the front end portion of the web app, I would have to take into account pagination if the goal
is to only show 10 results at a time. For the backend, I would set up an api to retrieve the data 
and then pass it to the front end. The front end code would then take the data that is passed and display the contents.
There is no data being stored in this application, therefore I wouldn't have to set up a database 
but I would think about caching data in the browser just in case the users retrieve the information frequently.
